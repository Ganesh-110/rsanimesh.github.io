                  <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence
                      that is concerned with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language.
                      The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand language as well as we do.
                      It is the driving force behind things like virtual assistants, speech recognition,
                      sentiment analysis, automatic text summarization, machine translation and much more.
                      In this post, you will learn the basics of natural language processing,
                      dive into some of its techniques and also learn how NLP benefited from the
                      recent advances in Deep Learning.</p>

                      It defines each step that an organization needs to take in order to take advantage of
                      machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive practical business value.</p>
