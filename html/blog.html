          <p>In this tutorial, we'll build a TensorFlow.js model to recognize images with a convolutional neural network.
            First, we'll train the classifier by having it "look" at thousands of handwritten digit images and their labels.
            Then we'll evaluate the classifier's accuracy using test data that the model has never seen.
            This task is considered a classification task as we are training the model to assign a category
            (the digit that appears in the image) to the input image.
            We will train the model by showing it many examples of inputs along with the correct output.
            This is referred to as supervised learning.</p>

          <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence
            that is concerned with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language.
            The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand language as well as we do.
            It is the driving force behind things like virtual assistants, speech recognition,
            sentiment analysis, automatic text summarization, machine translation and much more.
            In this post, you will learn the basics of natural language processing,
            dive into some of its techniques and also learn how NLP benefited from the
            recent advances in Deep Learning.</p>

          <p>The machine learning life cycle is the cyclical process that data science projects follow.
            It defines each step that an organization needs to take in order to take advantage of
            machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive practical business value.</p>
